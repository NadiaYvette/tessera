  Tessera — GATHER-LEDGER: the pgcl deferred-FREE phantom (#143's reincarnation UAF, pinned on the
  laptop 2026-07-01) and the per-sub-PTE genuine-ref FIX (Route 2), stated as a CODE SPEC.

  What the incarnation-stamp detector pinned on the laptop (1840 fires, PGCL143-REINCARN): the bug is
  NOT the mapcount (the floor works; R17's "undercount" was a measured-pre-clear artifact). It is a
  DEFERRED-FREE phantom, the `Deferred.lean` family-(A) hazard in its sharpest pgcl form:

    * The zap batches a cluster's sub-PTEs and DEFERS the free to tlb flush: `zap_present_ptes ->
      __tlb_remove_folio_pages(tlb, page, nr, false)` records `nr` (c01720e "defer all nr refs, no
      eager folio_ref_sub"); at flush `free_pages_and_swap_cache` reads the encoded `nr` and drops
      `nr` refs.  So the gather OWES `nr` free-refs across the window — `owed = nr`.
    * The comment claims "holding all nr refs keeps refcount > 0 until tlb_finish_mmu."  Empirically it
      does NOT: the folio's real refcount is LOWER than `nr` — a PHANTOM.  Three concurrent freers
      (pinned by the detector) then drive it to 0 before the flush: LRU batch drain
      (`folio_batch_move_lru`, ~1000/dominant), COW old-folio put (`wp_page_copy`, ~274), shmem/tmpfs
      eviction (`shmem_undo_range <- __fput`, ~40 — the tmpfs insight, vindicated).  Page freed +
      reused -> the flush's deferred `nr`-drop lands on the next INCARNATION -> `bad_page`.

  This file models that precisely and — per the standing model-enrichment cue — states WHAT THE FIX
  CODE MUST DO, as invariants each kernel site is checked against:

    refcount SPLITS by origin.  `base`   = non-mapping refs (allocation / LRU-isolation / page-cache) —
                                           exactly what the three racers drop.
                                `genuine` = mapping refs ACTUALLY taken (one real `folio_get` per
                                           sub-PTE that installed a present PTE).
    The folio refcount the kernel sees is `refs = base + genuine`.

  THE FIX (Route 2): every ADD site installs ONE genuine ref per new present sub-PTE, every unmap drops
  ONE — so `genuine` tracks the present-set EXACTLY (`Counters.RefTracksPresent`, the per-sub-PTE
  `refcount` discipline of `Counters.lean`).  Then the gather's `owed = nr = (sub-PTEs it cleared) <=
  mapped = genuine <= refs`: the deferred free is `Deferred.Pinned` BY CONSTRUCTION.  Dropping the
  ENTIRE base (every racer at once) still leaves `refs = mapped >= nr > 0` — the folio is live for the
  whole flush window, and by `Incarnation.pinned_inc_correct` it cannot reincarnate.  The UAF is
  structurally impossible.  The phantom (`genuine < mapped`) is the negation, and it reincarnates.

  This is the spec each kernel site must match; §"FIX-CODE OBLIGATIONS" below maps every site to the
  invariant it must preserve.

(one real `folio_get` per present sub-PTE); `mapped` = live sub-PTE mappings across ALL mms (ground
truth).  The kernel's folio refcount is `refs = base + genuine`. -/

holds. -/

/-- The zap of one batch clears `d` sub-PTEs of ONE mm and DEFERS a free of `d` refs to tlb flush

window is `⟨refs, d⟩`: `d` free-refs owed against `refs` currently held.  A single mm's cleared set
never exceeds the folio's total live mappings, so callers supply `d ≤ mapped`. -/

/-! ## The fix is sound — genuine refs PIN the deferred free -/

/-- **FIX SOUND.**  Under `Genuine`, a zap deferring `d ≤ mapped` free-refs is `Deferred.Pinned`
(`d ≤ refs`): the `d` refs it defers are exactly `d` of the genuine mapping refs the folio still holds
(plus a non-negative base).  So by `Deferred.pinned_live` the folio is LIVE for the whole flush
window. -/

/-- **FIX vs THE THREE RACERS.**  The freers pinned on the laptop — LRU batch drain, COW old-folio
put, shmem/tmpfs eviction — drop the folio's NON-mapping refs (the `base`).  Under `Genuine`, dropping
the ENTIRE base at once still leaves `refs = mapped ≥ d > 0`: the folio stays LIVE for the deferred
free.  No racer can free it while the flush is owed — the reincarnation is structurally impossible. -/

common late-teardown state) and a mapping skipped its genuine ref (`genuine < d`, the deferred count).
Then the deferred free owes `d` but the folio holds only `genuine < d` refs: a concurrent freer
dropping the remaining `genuine` reaches `refs = 0` WHILE the free is still owed.  This is exactly
`Deferred.unpinned_freed_while_owed` — the frame is freed and reusable with maintenance still
scheduled against it. -/

must do: move `refcount` in lockstep with the present-set, per sub-PTE. -/

/-- **ROUTE 2 CLOSES #143.**  Two mms share a cluster; each keeps the per-sub-PTE ref discipline.
Then any zap deferring `d ≤ mapped` free-refs is `Pinned` — so by `Deferred.pinned_live` the folio is
live for the whole flush window, and no racer frees it. -/

/-- …and therefore INCARNATION-CORRECT: the frame the deferred free targets cannot reincarnate.  The
capstone — the per-sub-PTE ref discipline of `Counters` discharges the `Incarnation` obligation, so
the reincarnation UAF pinned on the laptop is ruled out for all interleavings. -/

/-! ## FIX-CODE OBLIGATIONS — what each kernel site must do (the spec, mechanized above)

The single obligation is `RefTracksPresent` at every mm: `refcount` moves in lockstep with the
present-set, per sub-PTE.  Concretely, per site (`mm/memory.c`, `mm/rmap.c`):

  * do_anonymous_page  — install `rss` present sub-PTEs, take `rss` genuine refs.  ALREADY CLEAN:
      `if (rss > 1) folio_ref_add(folio, rss - 1)` atop the birth ref  ⟹ `addk rss` (audited).
  * copy_present_ptes (fork) — child gains `nr` present sub-PTEs, take `nr` refs:
      `folio_ref_add(folio, nr)` + `folio_try_dup_anon_rmap_ptes(.., nr, ..)`  ⟹ `addk nr` in the
      child mm.  The pgcl-anon batch path must add exactly `nr`, never fewer (the cross-mm suspect).
  * set_pte_range / filemap / swap-in — `folio_ref_add(folio, nr_ptes - 1)` atop the one held ref
      ⟹ `addk nr_ptes`.
  * zap_present_ptes — clear `nr` present sub-PTEs, DEFER exactly `nr` (`owed = nr`), never more than
      the batch actually cleared: `__tlb_remove_folio_pages(tlb, page, nr, false)`  ⟹ `remk nr` whose
      refs land at flush.  `d ≤ mapped` is precisely "defer no more than you cleared."
  * free_pages_and_swap_cache — at flush drop exactly the encoded `nr`  ⟹ the `remk nr` refs.
  * base ref (LRU-isolation / page-cache / alloc) is SEPARATE from `genuine`; the racers drop only it.
      `fix_survives_base_drop` is why that is safe once `genuine = mapped`.

`addk_preserves_refTracks` / `remk_preserves_refTracks` are the per-site proof obligations: each is
discharged by "this site moves `refcount` by the same `k` as `present`."  Any site that adds fewer
refs than present sub-PTEs (or defers more than it cleared) breaks `RefTracksPresent`, yielding
`Phantom`, yielding `phantom_freed_while_owed` — the exact laptop UAF.  That is the invariant the
static ref-balance audit checks each site against. -/
